GnuPrivacyGuard (GPG) brings GnuPG, the most trusted name in encryption, to Android.  Easily encrypt, decrypt, sign and verify files of any kind, just by sharing them to GPG. This app aims to provide a complete, integrated cryptographic toolkit integrated into the Android experience. GPG provides solid encryption for files private, and for verifying that files are who you think they are.  It includes optimizations to make it operate many times faster than other encryption packages on Android.

GPG provides an integrated experience, so clicking on OpenPGP files "just works".  You can also share files to GPG to decrypt, encrypt, sign, or verify them.  GPG will respond when you click on a OpenPGP fingerprint URL (one that starts with openpgp4fpr:).

GPG also gives you complete command line access to the entire GnuPG suite of encryption software. It also serves as the test bed for complete Android integration for all of GnuPG's crypto services, including OpenPGP, symmetric encryption, and more.


***Setup***
Before using GPG, be sure to launch the app and let it finish its installation process.  Once it has completed, then you're ready to use it!

If you want to use the command line, the easiest way to get started with GPG is to install Android Terminal Emulator. GPG will automatically configure Android Terminal Emulator as long as you have the "Allow PATH extensions" settings enabled. Get the Android Terminal Emulator at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jackpal.androidterm


***Features***
★ TRUSTED SECURITY: GnuPG already seamlessly integrates into Mac OSX (GPGtools), Windows (gpg4win), GNU/Linux, Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora.
★ OPEN STANDARD COMPLIANT: Full OpenPGP implementation following RFC2440 and RFC4880
★ PUBLIC KEY ENCRYPTION: Full interoperable replacement of the proprietary Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) standard.
★ BROAD ALGORITHM LANDSCAPE: Supports 3DES, AES, Blowfish, CAST5, DSA, ElGamal, MD5, RSA, RIPDE-MD-160, SHA-1, TIGER, and Twofish.
★ CONFIRMED SECURITY: Italian Police, the FBI, and British police have been unable to crack its security and have resorted to demanding private keys. It’s been likened as “the closest you’re likely to get to military-grade encryption” by cryptographer Bruce Schneier.
★ KEYSERVER SUPPORT: Integrated support for HKP keyservers (ipv4.pool.sks-keyservers.net).
★ WE SPEAK YOUR LANGUAGE: GPG is available for friends who speak: Arabic (العربية), English, French (Français), German (Deutsch), Norwegian (Norsk), Portuguese (Português), Spanish (Español).
