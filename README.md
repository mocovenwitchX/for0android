# GNUPG for Android

**A port of the whole gnupg 2.1 suite to Android.**

If you are using these tools in your own apps, we'd love to hear about it. Email us
at root@guardianproject.info.

GNU Privacy Guard gives you access to the entire GnuPG suite of encryption
software. GPG is GNUâ€™s tool for end-to-end secure communication and encrypted
data storage. This trusted protocol is the free software alternative to
PGP. GnuPG 2.1 is the new modularized version of GnuPG that now supports
OpenPGP and S/MIME.



## Using GnuPG from the Terminal

Before using gpgcli, be sure to launch the app and let it finish its
installation process. Once it has completed, then you're ready to use it. The
easiest way to get started with gpgcli is to install Android Terminal
Emulator. gpgcli will automatically configure Android Terminal Emulator as
long as you have the "Allow PATH extensions" settings enabled. Get the Android
Terminal Emulator at
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jackpal.androidterm

Currently, this app offers the full gnupg suite of commands in the terminal.
When you run the GnuPG tools in an app, a GNUPGHOME folder will be created for
that specific app.  Because of the Android permissions model, its not possible
to create a shared GNUPGHOME without having it world-writable.

### Use in Android Terminal Emulator

The app automatically configures Android Terminal Emulator to use the GnuPG
tools, as long as you have the *Allow PATH extensions* preference set.

### Manual configuration and using it with other apps

In order to use the GnuPG tools in your app, preferred terminal emulator, or
adb shell, you need to set the `PATH` to include the full path to the GnuPG
aliases, for example:

    export PATH=$PATH:/data/data/info.guardianproject.gpg/app_opt/aliases

Or you can call the aliases using the full path:

    /data/data/info.guardianproject.gpg/app_opt/aliases/gpg --encrypt secretfile.txt

### Setting up all of the tools

To enable the whole suite of tools, including dirmngr to work with keyservers,
you need to set another environment variable:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/data/data/info.guardianproject.gpg/app_opt/lib:/data/data/info.guardianproject.gpg/lib

The technical reason why is that GnuPG uses a lot of shared libraries, and
the only way Android has for finding shared libraries is the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
environment variable.  GNU/Linux has `rpath`, Mac OS X has *install names*,
but Android has none of this stuff.


## Please Report Bugs

This is an early release of a big project, so there will inevitable be
bugs. Help us improve this software by filing bug reports about any problem
that you encounter. Feature requests are also welcome!

## Target Platform

We would like to target as many Android platforms as possible.  Currently
there are two limiting APIs:

* regex:
    provided in Android 2.2, SDK android-8 and above
* pthread_rwlock\*:
    provided in Android 2.3, SDK android-9 and above

regex could easily be included in the build, pthread_rwlock\* would be more 
difficult.


## Build Setup

On **Debian/Ubuntu/Mint/etc.**:

	sudo apt-get install autoconf automake libtool transfig wget patch \
	texinfo ant gettext build-essential ia32-libs bison

On **Fedora 17 x64**:

	sudo yum install ncurses-libs.i686 libstdc++.i686 libgcc.i686 zlib.i686 gcc.i686

Install the Android NDK for the command line version, and the Android SDK for
the Android app version:

SDK: http://developer.android.com/sdk/
NDK: http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/


## Building

First the get all of the source code from git:

	git clone https://github.com/guardianproject/gnupg-for-android
	git submodule init
	git submodule update


### How to build the whole app

    make -C external/ distclean clean-assets
	make -C external/
	ndk-build clean
	ndk-build
	android update project --path . --name GnuPrivacyGuard
	ant clean debug


### How to Build Individual Components

To compile the components individually you can use commands like (the order
that you run them is important):

	make -C external/ gnupg-install
	make -C external/ gnupg-static
	make -C external/ gpgme-install

The results will be in `external/data/data/info.guardianproject.gpg`


### How to Build the Android Test App

    make -C external/ clean-assets
	make -C external/ android-assets
	ndk-build
	android update project --path . --name GnuPrivacyGuard
	ant clean debug
